---> java - programming language 
		- OOPS

--> JDK - java Devlopment kit
	
	1. javac  - Java compiler
	2. JRE - Java Runtime Environment
	3. Zip file - built in classes

-> java is a case sensitive language.

-> In java always write class with first letter Capital.
	ex:  String , System 

-> compile java file
	javac filename.java

-> when we compile java file it make .class file

-> run 	
	java filename

-> one java file you can write multiple class and Multiple main Method

->If java file have multipal classes than when we compile multiple class file generated.

-> we don't need of main method for compile java file but we can't run without main method.

-> If java file does not have any public class than we can write any file name.

-> If java file have public class than file name should be same as public class name.

-> one java file have at most one public class(0,1)

11. count total no of notes in given amount - 1552
	500 - 3
	200-0
	100-0
	50 - 1
	10-0

13. Write a program to input electricity unit charge and calculate the total 
	electricity bill according to the given condition:

	For first 50 units Rs. 0.50/unit
	For next 100 units Rs. 0.75/unit
	For next 100 units Rs. 1.20/unit
	For unit above 250 Rs. 1.50/unit

	300 
	50 - 0.50 = 25
	100 - 0.75=75
	100 - 1.20 = 120
	50 - 1.50  = 75   total - 295
